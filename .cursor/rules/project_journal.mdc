# Project Journal Guidelines

## Overview

The project journal serves as a continuous record of the project's progress, decisions, challenges, and solutions. It provides valuable context for all stakeholders and creates a historical record of the project's evolution.

## Journal Structure

### 1. Entry Organization

- Create a new journal entry for each significant work session
- Store entries in a chronological directory structure:
  ```
  /journal
  ├── entries/
  │   ├── YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
  │   ├── YYYY-MM-DD-title.md
  │   └── ...
  └── index.md  # Overview and entry index
  ```
- Name files with date prefix for easy chronological sorting

### 2. Entry Content

Each journal entry should include:

- **Header**: Date, time, and entry title
- **Goals**: Objectives for the current work session
- **Progress**: Accomplishments and advancements
- **Challenges**: Problems encountered and solutions implemented
- **Decisions**: Key choices made and their rationale
- **Next Steps**: Planned activities for the next session
- **Resources**: Links to relevant documentation, research, or references

## Implementation Requirements

### 1. Entry Creation

- Create a new entry at the start of each significant work session
- Always verify the current date and time using the terminal:
  ```bash
  date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"
  ```
- Use the verified date in the entry header and filename

### 2. Entry Template

```markdown

**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Time**: HH:MM:SS
**Duration**: [Approximate work session length]

## Challenges & Solutions

```

### 3. Maintenance Procedures

- Update the journal index with each new entry
- Reference specific commits, files, or documentation when relevant
- Include code snippets, terminal output, or screenshots as needed
- Cross-reference journal entries with project plan tasks

### 4. Best Practices

- Be concise but thorough
- Focus on meaningful insights and progress, not routine activities
- Document the reasoning behind decisions, not just the decisions themselves
- Capture unexpected behaviors, unusual solutions, and lessons learned
- Maintain professional tone and clarity

## Integration with Project Workflow

- Review previous journal entries before starting new work sessions
- Reference journal entries in commit messages when applicable
- Use journal entries to inform project status reports
- Include journal review in milestone completion checklist

Remember to always verify the current date and time before creating a new journal entry to ensure accuracy in the project timeline.
