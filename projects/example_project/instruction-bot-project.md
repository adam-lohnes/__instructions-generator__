# InstructoBot: A Meta-Instruction Generation Game

## 1. Project Overview
- **Project Name**: InstructoBot
- **Project Type**: Technical (Web Application)
- **Project Description**: A playful web application that gamifies the process of instruction generation. Users interact with a charming robot character who needs help learning how to write instructions for various tasks. The game serves as both an entertaining experience and a practical demonstration of structured instruction generation.
- **Key Objectives**:
  - Create an engaging, interactive web interface featuring an animated robot character
  - Implement a game loop where players help the robot write instructions
  - Demonstrate the power of structured instruction generation in a fun way
  - Showcase different instruction types (technical, creative, personal tasks)
- **Target Audience**: 
  - Developers interested in instruction generation
  - Educators teaching procedural thinking
  - Anyone interested in learning about structured documentation
- **Success Criteria**:
  - Functional web application with responsive design
  - Engaging robot character with personality
  - At least 5 different instruction generation scenarios
  - Ability to save and share generated instructions

## 2. Initial Planning Phase
- **Resources Needed**:
  - Frontend: React.js, TypeScript
  - Styling: TailwindCSS
  - Animation: Framer Motion
  - State Management: Zustand
  - Backend: Local storage (MVP), Optional: Firebase for sharing
- **Conceptual Framework**:
  - Single-page application with game-like interface
  - Robot character as the main interaction point
  - Progressive difficulty in instruction tasks
  - Reward system for well-structured instructions
- **Dependencies**:
  - Node.js and npm/yarn
  - Modern web browser
  - Git for version control
- **Research Required**:
  - Robot character design inspiration
  - Game mechanics for instruction writing
  - Best practices for gamification
  - Instruction templates for different scenarios

## 3. Project Plan & Knowledge Base
- **Project Phases**:
  Phase 1: Setup and Basic Structure
  - [ ] Initialize React project with TypeScript
  - [ ] Set up TailwindCSS and basic styling
  - [ ] Create project structure
  - [ ] Implement basic routing

  Phase 2: Core Game Components
  - [ ] Design and implement robot character
  - [ ] Create instruction template system
  - [ ] Develop basic game loop
  - [ ] Implement local storage

  Phase 3: Game Content
  - [ ] Create instruction scenarios
  - [ ] Write robot dialogue
  - [ ] Design feedback system
  - [ ] Implement progress tracking

  Phase 4: Polish and Enhancement
  - [ ] Add animations
  - [ ] Implement sound effects
  - [ ] Add sharing capabilities
  - [ ] Testing and optimization

- **Priority Framework**:
  Must-Have:
  - Functional instruction generation system
  - Interactive robot character
  - Basic game loop
  - Local storage for progress

  Nice-to-Have:
  - Cloud storage and sharing
  - Advanced animations
  - Sound effects
  - Achievement system

- **Risk Assessment**:
  - Complex animations might impact performance
  - Balancing game difficulty
  - Ensuring instructions are actually useful
  - Managing scope creep

## 4. Project Setup
- **Environment Setup**:
  ```bash
  # Initialize new React project with TypeScript
  npx create-react-app instructobot --template typescript
  cd instructobot
  
  # Install dependencies
  npm install tailwindcss framer-motion zustand @heroicons/react
  
  # Initialize Tailwind CSS
  npx tailwindcss init
  ```
