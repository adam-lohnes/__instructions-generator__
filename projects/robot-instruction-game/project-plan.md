# Robot Instruction Game - Project Plan

## Overview
This project is a "Hello World" webapp that demonstrates the capabilities of instruction generation systems through a meta-game about helping a happy little robot understand instructions.

## Project Phases Checklist

### Phase 1: Setup and Foundation
- [ ] Initialize project with React framework
- [ ] Set up development environment with npm
- [ ] Create basic application structure following best practices
- [ ] Implement responsive layout framework using CSS Grid/Flexbox
- [ ] Design initial UI mockups for robot character and game interface

### Phase 2: Core Gameplay Development
- [ ] Create robot character with basic animations (idle, success, error)
- [ ] Implement instruction input interface with text area and submit button
- [ ] Develop basic instruction parsing system that recognizes simple commands
- [ ] Build first set of 5 simple challenges with clear objectives
- [ ] Create feedback mechanisms for correct/incorrect user instructions

### Phase 3: Enhanced Gameplay Features
- [ ] Add progressive difficulty levels (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
- [ ] Implement scoring/achievement system to track player progress
- [ ] Create advanced animation states for robot (thinking, celebrating, confused)
- [ ] Add sound effects and visual feedback for improved user experience
- [ ] Develop hint system for players who get stuck

### Phase 4: Polish and Refinement
- [ ] Optimize performance for smooth animations and transitions
- [ ] Refine UI/UX based on testing feedback
- [ ] Enhance accessibility features (keyboard navigation, screen reader support)
- [ ] Create additional challenge content (at least 10 total challenges)
- [ ] Implement analytics to track user progress and common mistakes

### Phase 5: Deployment and Documentation
- [ ] Prepare application for production (build optimization)
- [ ] Deploy to GitHub Pages or similar hosting platform
- [ ] Complete user documentation with how-to guides
- [ ] Finalize developer documentation with component breakdown
- [ ] Create showcase materials (screenshots, demo video)

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Structure
- React application with functional components and hooks
- CSS Modules for component-scoped styling
- State management with Context API or Redux (if complexity warrants)
- Animation system using Framer Motion or CSS animations

### Key Components
- **RobotCharacter**: Animated robot that responds to instructions
- **InstructionInput**: Text area with syntax highlighting for commands
- **ChallengeDisplay**: Shows current challenge objectives
- **FeedbackPanel**: Provides hints and error messages
- **ProgressTracker**: Shows user advancement through challenges

### Instruction Parser
- Simple natural language processing to understand commands
- Command categories: movement, interaction, conditions
- Error detection and helpful feedback generation
